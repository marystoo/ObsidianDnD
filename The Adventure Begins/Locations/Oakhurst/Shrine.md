Advice, information, and healing are among the services dispensed at the village's shrine to [[Eldath]].

It is maintain by [[Dem Corkie Nackle]].

Inside the ivy covered knee high walls is a small garden courtyard. At the back there is a stone shrine with a fountain that is a small waterfall cascading into a peacefully still pool.  No ripples can be seen in the pool.  Next to the fountain is a low alter for offerings.  The offerings include a broken short sword and a rusted knife.  Eldath is a pacifist and appreciates the gifts of violent objects which are broken.  There is also a bench to meditate and reflect.
