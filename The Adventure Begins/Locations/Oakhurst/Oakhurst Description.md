The community closest to the Sunless Citadel.  

Read to the players:
	You come to the village of Oakhurst. A small farming community just off the trade route between Neverwinter and Luskan to the north.  There is a blanket of heat on the hills left by the setting summer sun. Upon entering the square you immediately see a low, ivy covered wall surrounding the village's holy place. Not far down is a farely sizable tavern with a sign swinging above the door that reads *Ol' Boar Inn.* There are other buildings of note if you travel further in but mostly you see a number of homes set against the idyllic country side with the Neverwinter Forest looming to the east and the low peaks of the The Crags rising out of the tree tops.  And with the sun beginning to set, the forest is turning dark and a bit foreboding.  

Mount Hotenow is the tallest of the mountains and is an active volcano.  It errupted close to a century ago.  Its top now looks like severed teeth and is often refered to as the gates to hell. It is inhabited by fire elementals and it keeps the Neverwinter River warm all year long.
