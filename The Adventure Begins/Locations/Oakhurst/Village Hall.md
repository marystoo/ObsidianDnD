The center of government in Oakhurst includes the office of the [[Mayor Vurnor Leng]].

You enter into a building with clean oaken floors. There is a pair of benches one on each wall.  Directly ahead of you is a counter with an open door behind it.  On the counter is a small bell.  You can see a hallway going off to the left before the counter.  No one is standing behind the counter but you do see some movement behind the open door.

A small woman comes to the counter if the bell is rung. [[Violet O'dare]]

The hall goes straight down the outside wall of the building. One side has windows that lets the daylight through (or lamp light if at night). The other side of the hallway as three doors - A large set of double doors in the center and two single doors on either side.

There is a door at the end of the hallway that is slightly ajar but you cannot see into the room.

The first door in the hallway is a small meeting room - empty - with a table and 6 chairs around it.  The table is a little oversized for the room so it feels a bit cramped.

The double doors open into the main Hall of the town hall. It is a large room with benches set up on each side of the room with a dais at the front.   If entered during the day, there is a chance that women are in there decorating for a wedding that is happening in the next few days.

The next room is just a broom closet.

The door at the end of the hall is the Mayor's office.  He is in his office in the afternoons.
