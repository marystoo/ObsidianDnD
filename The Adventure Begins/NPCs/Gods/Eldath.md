**Eldath**, also known as **The Green Goddess**, **Mother Guardian of Groves**, or the **Mother of the Waters**, was a lake spirit who acted as the guardian of groves and watersheds. Her presence was felt wherever there was calm.

Eldath was a pacifist who avoided hostile action, even if threatened. Although shy, quiet, and enigmatic, the Green Goddess was possessed of unknown depths of character and unexpressed resolve that could not be broken. Eldath protected rivers, streams, and druids' groves.

*Who is Eldath? Eldath is a goddess. They call her the Quiet One. She's a healer, and she serves Silvanus and helps the druids of the Emerald Enclave.*
