"My children, Talgen and Sharwyn, have gotten into trouble, I fear. They left last week with an adventuring party they hired from the south to explore the ruins. I gave each of them a scrying stone in order to check in with me but I have not heard from them in some days. I fear the worst. Please, bring me back my children. Or at the very least, bring me back the rings they wear on their pinkies so I may bury them and have peace."
